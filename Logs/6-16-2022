been doing some freeCodeCamp stuff  

tried using mongoose with mongoDB, because passport npm links to this https://github.com/mjhea0/passport-social-auth  
still dont know authentication properly. the way this one does it seems good even though 7 years old. makes more sense in my brain 

notes for web app:  
think full authentication stack will be passport, auth0, with sessions stored in db
