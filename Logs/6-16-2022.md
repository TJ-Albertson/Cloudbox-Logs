# 6/16/2022 - Baby's first authentication

been doing some freeCodeCamp stuff  

tried using mongoose with mongoDB, because passport npm links to this https://github.com/mjhea0/passport-social-auth  
still dont know authentication properly. the way this one does it seems good even though 7 years old.

notes for web app:  
think full authentication stack will be passport, auth0, with sessions stored in db
