# 6/13/2022 - Deconstructing Code

-Created MERN stack application using mongoDB guide  
-Successfully routed sample database/collection through stack  

MongoDB error checklist:  
-Database Access (account)  
-Network Access (IP address)  
-.env file  

bare minimum for routing new collection  
[Database->Backend->Frontend]  
(one way of doing it)  

MongoDB:  
-loaded sample dataset (Using mongoDbB Atlas, can only use sample in free version. plan to run own mongoDB in cluster)  

Server:  
-app.use new router in main server js file  
-create router js; add routes that point to mongoDB for viewing and editing; +boilerplate router stuff and mongodb objectid  

Client(React):  
-create new component and point to serverside router (I copied most of code from other component)  
-In main client js file, add import for new component and add route to component  


*sidenote1: noticed excessive load time for 90MB database size  
**sidenote2: found database isn't suitable for large file storage  
***sidenote3: found sessions can be stored in database. maybe better solution than using express-session  

**(edit 9/15/2022, I now have a much better understanding of the purpse of databases and sessions)**
