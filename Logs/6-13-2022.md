bare minimum for routing new collection  
[Database->Backend->Frontend]  
(one way of doing it)  
============================================================================  

MongoDB:  
-loaded sample dataset (Using mongoDbB Atlas, can only use sample in free version. plan to run own mongoDB in cluster)  

Server:  
-app.use new router in main server js file  
-create router js; add routes that point to mongoDB for viewing and editing; +boilerplate router stuff and mongodb objectid  

Client(React):  
-create new component and point to serverside router (I copied most of code from other component)  
-In main client js file, add import for new component and add route to component  


***sidenote: noticed excessive load time for 90MB database size
