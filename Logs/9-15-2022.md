# 9/15/2022 - Folder Navigation UI, Context Menu, API changes, Future UI Recreation

### Folder Navigation  
I'm using the folder navigation system mentioned in previous log. One main difference being the directory being based off the the folders unique ID in mongodDB and not its name. 
Issues with nested folders having the same names as folders higher up. 

### Context Menu  
Used to create new folders, rename files and folders, delete files and folders, adn download files. This was difficult to implement because I each box to have a context menu but I only want one context menu on the screen at a time.
My solution was to put the Context menu above the boxes. I know this is not ideal design for React because I have to pass information up but it works. 

### API changes  
I have been working on making my API better resemble a RESTful API with its naming conventions and specifying http methods.  

### Future UI Recreation  
Working under bootstrap's scss has given me a lot of issues. I am going to completely redo the UI with just CSS and get rid of bootstrap. 
I  would not use bootstrap again in a complex project (which it probably isn't inteneded for anyway).
