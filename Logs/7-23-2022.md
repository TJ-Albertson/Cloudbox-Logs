## React  
made my own components controlled by state to make the boxes. Created buttons to add and remove boxes.
Using useEffect to check if user has valid token to auto log them in or out. Also using react router.

## HTML 
I like finding html tags that have the functionality I need in lieu of using javascript/react. Right now I am using HTMl for the drag and drop features with the boxes.  
I originally wanted to use something like react-dnd or react-beautiful-dnd but the extra code required isn't worth it right now when I just want it to work.  
I may add one of these packages later to make the drag and drop look better.

## CSS  
I'm using CSS for he navBar and a grid for the boxes. Same as HTMl, I've learned that they're a lot of features in CSS you can use instead of javascipt

## Authentication  
I had trouble setting up Auth0 with the two apps (react and exress). I'm doing it on my own for now.  
Storing password(using bcrypt) and email in MongoDB then sending json web token to react.  
Probably gonna go back to Auth0 sometime because I think it'll be easier to do email verification and MFA then do it myself.
